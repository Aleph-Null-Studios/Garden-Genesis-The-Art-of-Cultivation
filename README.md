# Garden Genesis: The Art of Cultivation

A game for Global Game Jam '23 by Alex Woods, Chino Beach, Caleb Brazeau, and Grace Fowler

A game where you are breeding flowers in order to grow the most beautiful plants you can.

Breed the flowers to be larger and more vibrant, the stems to be longer, and the leaves to be fuller.

You may even stumble upon some alchemical plants, which are highly sought after ingrediants to the local alchemists.
